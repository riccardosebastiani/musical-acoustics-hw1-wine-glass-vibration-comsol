Finite Element simulation of wine glass vibrations using COMSOL Multiphysics. Comparison between axisymmetric and full 3D modal analysis.

# Musical Acoustics – HW1: Wine Glass Vibration (COMSOL FEM)

This project analyzes the vibrational behavior of a wine glass using Finite Element Modeling (FEM) in COMSOL Multiphysics.

## 🎯 Objective
To simulate and compare the vibrational modes (eigenfrequencies) of a wine glass using both 2D axisymmetric and full 3D models.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- COMSOL Multiphysics (Structural Mechanics module)
- Axisymmetric geometry simplification
- 3D modeling and meshing
- Eigenfrequency analysis

## 📄 Included Files
- `HL1.pdf`: Complete report of the simulation and analysis
- `HL1.mph`: COMSOL project file (requires COMSOL to open)

## 📌 Key Concepts
- Symmetry-based optimization
- FEM modal analysis
- Comparison of deformation patterns
- Evaluation of rigid-body modes vs. true vibration modes
